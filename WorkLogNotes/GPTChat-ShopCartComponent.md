ChatGPT

Sure, I can help you create the `ShopCart` Vue 3 component as you've described. Here's how you can achieve that:

1. Create a new Vue component file named `ShopCart.vue`.
2. In the `ShopCart.vue` file, add the following code:
    

```vue
<template>
  <div class="shop-cart" @click="openCart">
    <span class="cart-icon">
      <i class="mdi mdi-cart"></i>
    </span>
    <span class="cart-count">{{ total }}</span>
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import { defineProps, computed } from 'vue';

interface ProductInCart {
  // Define your ProductInCart properties here
  quantity: number;
}

interface ShoppingCart {
  products: ProductInCart[];
}

const props = defineProps<{
  cart: ShoppingCart;
}>();

const total = computed(() => {
  return props.cart.products.reduce((total, product) => total + product.quantity, 0);
});

const openCart = () => {
  // Implement logic to open the cart or navigate to the cart page
};
</script>

<style scoped>
.shop-cart {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  cursor: pointer;
}

.cart-icon {
  font-size: 1.5rem;
  margin-right: 0.5rem;
}

.cart-count {
  background-color: #f44336;
  color: white;
  border-radius: 50%;
  padding: 0.25rem 0.5rem;
  font-size: 0.8rem;
}
</style>

```

In this code:

- The `ShopCart` component is defined with a template that displays an icon and the total number of products in the cart.
- The `props` variable is defined using `defineProps` to access the `cart` prop.
- The `total` computed property calculates the total number of products in the cart.
- The `openCart` function is a placeholder for opening the cart or navigating to the cart page. You can implement this according to your application's navigation logic.

You can then use the `ShopCart` component in your other Vue components by passing the `cart` prop:

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <!-- Your template content here -->
    <ShopCart :cart="shoppingCart" />
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import { ref } from 'vue';

// Import ShopCart component
import ShopCart from '@/components/ShopCart.vue'; // Adjust the path as needed

// Assuming you have a shopping cart
const shoppingCart = ref({
  products: [
    // Your list of products in the cart
  ],
});
</script>

```

Please adjust the code according to your actual data structure and design requirements.

## Let's code parent component code where ShopCart will be included as part of header line which include `store name` and ShopCart on the right corner

Certainly! Let's create a parent component where the `ShopCart` component will be included as part of the header, along with the store name and the cart icon. Here's how you can achieve that:

1. Create a new Vue component file named `StoreHeader.vue`.
    
2. In the `StoreHeader.vue` file, add the following code:
    

```vue
<template>
  <header class="store-header">
    <div class="store-name">{{ storeName }}</div>
    <div class="cart-container">
      <ShopCart :cart="shoppingCart" />
    </div>
  </header>
</template>

<script setup>
import { ref } from 'vue';

// Import ShopCart component
import ShopCart from '@/components/ShopCart.vue'; // Adjust the path as needed

// Assuming you have a store name and shopping cart
const storeName = ref('My Store');
const shoppingCart = ref({
  products: [
    // Your list of products in the cart
  ],
});
</script>

<style scoped>
.store-header {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
  background-color: #333;
  color: white;
  padding: 1rem;
}

.store-name {
  font-size: 1.2rem;
}

.cart-container {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
}
</style>

```

In this code:

- The `StoreHeader` component is defined with a header template that displays the store name on the left and the `ShopCart` component on the right.
- The `storeName` and `shoppingCart` variables are defined using `ref` for the store name and the shopping cart.
- The `ShopCart` component is included within a `div` with the class `cart-container`.

Now, you can use the `StoreHeader` component in other Vue components:

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <StoreHeader />
    <!-- Your template content here -->
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import StoreHeader from '@/components/StoreHeader.vue'; // Adjust the path as needed
</script>
```

Remember to adjust the code according to your actual data structure, design requirements, and file paths. This setup allows you to easily include the `ShopCart` component along with the store name in the header of your parent component.
