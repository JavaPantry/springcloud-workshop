# Build docker image with dependency from another module 

## I have Spring cloud project with few microservices submodules. Each module has it's own pom file and  Dockerfile. Root spring cloud project has  docker-compose file which build each submodule whith help of Dockerfile. Also I have submodule with shared data transfer objects and build to dto.jar file. One of microservices, let' call it "product-service", have dependency from this dto.jar . How  I can include (or better build ) dto.jar to dockerized  product-service?

To include the dto.jar file in the Dockerized product-service microservice, you have a few options:

Add the JAR file to the Docker image: In this approach, you can copy the dto.jar file into the Docker image during the build process. You can modify the Dockerfile of the product-service module to include the following lines:

```docker
# Copy the dto.jar file into the Docker image
COPY path/to/dto.jar /path/in/container/dto.jar
```

Ensure that you replace path/to/dto.jar with the actual path to the dto.jar file and /path/in/container/dto.jar with the desired path inside the Docker container.

After adding these lines, when you build the Docker image for the product-service microservice using the docker-compose file, the dto.jar file will be included in the Docker image.

Create a shared volume: If you want to avoid rebuilding the Docker image every time the dto.jar file changes, you can create a shared volume between the product-service microservice and the host machine. This approach allows you to mount the directory containing the dto.jar file directly into the Docker container without copying it. To achieve this, modify the docker-compose.yml file to include the following lines:

```yaml
services:
product-service:
volumes:
- /path/on/host/dto.jar:/path/in/container/dto.jar
``` 

Replace /path/on/host/dto.jar with the actual path to the dto.jar file on the host machine and /path/in/container/dto.jar with the desired path inside the Docker container. This configuration mounts the dto.jar file from the host machine to the specified path inside the product-service container.

With this setup, any changes made to the dto.jar file on the host machine will be reflected immediately inside the Docker container.

Choose the option that best suits your requirements and integrate it into your existing project setup.



## let's consider I have java spring project structure like this: 

- projectRoot
    - docker-compose.yml
    - product-service module folder
        - Dockerfile
        - pom.xml
    - shared-data module folder
        - pom.xml

- write Dockerfile which will build product-service with shared-data dependency
  ChatGPT
  To build the product-service module with the shared-data module as a dependency in the Dockerfile, you can follow these steps:

In the Dockerfile located in the product-service module folder, add the following lines:

```docker
# Use a base Java image
FROM openjdk:11

# Set the working directory in the Docker container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the project files to the working directory
COPY . /app

# Build the shared-data module
RUN cd shared-data && mvn clean install

# Build the product-service module
RUN mvn clean install

# Set the entry point for the Docker container
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "target/product-service.jar"]
```

Here, we start with the base Java image, set the working directory to /app, and copy the entire project into the container. Then, we navigate to the shared-data module directory and build it using mvn clean install. After that, we return to the root directory and build the product-service module using mvn clean install. Finally, we set the entry point to run the product-service.jar file.

In the docker-compose.yml file located in the projectRoot, you can use the following configuration for the product-service service:

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  product-service:
    build:
      context: ./product-service
    ports:
    - 8080:8080
    depends_on:
    - shared-data
  shared-data:
    build:
      context: ./shared-data
```

This configuration specifies that the product-service service should be built using the Dockerfile in the product-service directory (context: ./product-service) and that it depends on the shared-data service. The shared-data service is built using the Dockerfile in the shared-data directory (context: ./shared-data).

Now, when you run docker-compose up from the projectRoot, it will build both the product-service and shared-data modules and start the containers. The product-service container will have the shared-data dependency built and included.

Ensure that the necessary dependencies and configurations are present in the pom.xml files of both the product-service and shared-data modules to successfully build them with Maven.

## Clarify

In the Dockerfile located in the product-service module folder, add the following lines:

```docker
# Use a base Java image
FROM openjdk:11

# Set the working directory in the Docker container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the project files to the working directory
COPY . /app

# Build the shared-data module
RUN cd shared-data && mvn clean install
```

you tell docker to copy product-service module folder to /app and then build shared-data module. But shared-data module is not in /app folder. It is in projectRoot folder. How docker will find it?

## Clarify

Here is my Dockerfile within product-service module folder:
Do you agree that I should copy shared-data module folder to /shared-data folder before build it?


```docker
FROM maven:3.8.6-amazoncorretto-19 AS buildOne
WORKDIR /shared-data
COPY ../shared-data /shared-data
RUN mvn package

WORKDIR /app
COPY . /app
RUN mvn package

FROM amazoncorretto:19-al2-jdk as buildTwo
WORKDIR /app
ARG JAR_FILE=/app/target/*.jar
COPY --from=buildOne ${JAR_FILE} application.jar
RUN java -Djarmode=layertools -jar application.jar extract

FROM amazoncorretto:19-al2-jdk
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=buildTwo /app/dependencies/ ./
COPY --from=buildTwo /app/snapshot-dependencies/ ./
COPY --from=buildTwo /app/spring-boot-loader/ ./
COPY --from=buildTwo /app/application/ ./
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "org.springframework.boot.loader.JarLauncher"]
```
