# Nuxt 3 error page within pages folder not rendered

In Nuxt 3, the way error pages are handled has changed compared to previous versions. In Nuxt 3, error pages are no longer placed directly in the `pages` folder. Instead, they are defined in a dedicated `error` directory.

To create a custom error page in Nuxt 3, follow these steps:

1. Create an `error` directory inside the root of your Nuxt project.
2. Inside the `error` directory, create a file with the name corresponding to the HTTP error code you want to handle. For example, if you want to handle a 404 error, create a file named `404.vue`.
3. Customize the error page by editing the content of the created file. You can use Vue.js components, Nuxt layouts, and any other Nuxt-related features.
4. Save the changes.

Here's an example of what the directory structure might look like:

```
project
├── ...
├── pages
│   ├── index.vue
│   └── ...
├── error
│   ├── 404.vue
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

By following this structure, Nuxt 3 will automatically route to the appropriate error page based on the HTTP error code. For example, if a 404 error occurs, Nuxt will render the `404.vue` file located in the `error` directory.

Make sure that you have the latest version of Nuxt installed and that you have migrated your Nuxt 2 project to Nuxt 3 properly, as the file structure and behavior may differ.
