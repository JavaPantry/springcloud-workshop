# Mapstruct Recursive Dto issue 
I have two entities, one is a parent and the other is a child. The child has a reference to the parent and the parent has a list of children.

```java
@Entity
public class OrderHeader extends BaseEntity {
    private String name;
    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "orderHeader", cascade = {CascadeType.PERSIST, CascadeType.REMOVE}, fetch = FetchType.EAGER)
    private Set<OrderLine> orderLines;
}

@Entity
public class OrderLine extends BaseEntity {

    @ManyToOne
    private OrderHeader orderHeader;

    private Long productId;
    private Integer quantityOrdered;

}
```

In database OrderLine properties mapped to

```java
product_id bigint,
quantity_ordered integer,
order_header_id bigint,
```

When I save OrderHeader instance with to OrderLine instances, the OrderLine instances are saved with order_header_id, product_id and quantity_ordered equal NULL.
I want to map the parent to a DTO and the DTO should contain a list of child DTOs.

It seems like you're facing an issue where the order_header_id, product_id, and quantity_ordered fields in the OrderLine instances are being saved as NULL in the database. This issue might be related to how you are setting up and saving the relationships between OrderHeader and OrderLine entities.

Here's a possible explanation for this issue:

Cascading Behavior: In your OrderHeader entity, you've defined a cascade behavior of CascadeType.PERSIST and CascadeType.REMOVE for the orderLines relationship. This means that when you save an OrderHeader, the associated OrderLine instances should also be saved automatically.

Bidirectional Relationship: You have a bidirectional relationship between OrderHeader and OrderLine. This means that while you have set the relationship from OrderHeader to OrderLine using the orderLines field, you also need to make sure that when you create an OrderLine instance, you correctly set the OrderHeader it belongs to.

Here's an example of how you should be creating and saving an OrderHeader with its associated OrderLine instances:

```java
OrderHeader orderHeader = new OrderHeader();
orderHeader.setName("Sample Order");

OrderLine orderLine1 = new OrderLine();
orderLine1.setOrderHeader(orderHeader);
orderLine1.setProductId(1L);
orderLine1.setQuantityOrdered(5);

OrderLine orderLine2 = new OrderLine();
orderLine2.setOrderHeader(orderHeader);
orderLine2.setProductId(2L);
orderLine2.setQuantityOrdered(3);

Set<OrderLine> orderLines = new HashSet<>();
orderLines.add(orderLine1);
orderLines.add(orderLine2);

orderHeader.setOrderLines(orderLines);

entityManager.persist(orderHeader);
```


Make sure that when you create an OrderLine instance, you properly set its associated OrderHeader using the setOrderHeader() method. This will ensure that the foreign key relationship is properly established and the order_header_id, product_id, and quantity_ordered fields are populated correctly in the database.

If you're still facing issues after making sure you've correctly set up the relationships and saved the entities, it might be helpful to provide more context on how you're creating and persisting the entities in your application, including the code that's triggering the save operation.

for getters and setters I rely on lombok.

Test method which create OrderHeader with orderLines and save it to database

```
@Test
    public void testOrderHeaderRepository() {
        OrderLine orderLine1 = new OrderLine().builder().quantityOrdered(1).productId(1L).build();
        OrderLine orderLine2 = new OrderLine().builder().quantityOrdered(1).productId(2L).build();

        OrderHeader orderHeader = new OrderHeader().builder()
                .name("test order")
                .orderLines(new HashSet<OrderLine>() {{
                    add(orderLine1);
                    add(orderLine2);
                }})
                .build();


        orderLine1.setOrderHeader(orderHeader);
        orderLine2.setOrderHeader(orderHeader);

        OrderHeader orderHeaderSaved = orderHeaderRepository.save(orderHeader);
```
ChatGPT
Based on the code you provided, it looks like you're using Lombok's builder pattern for creating instances of your entities, and you're also setting the bidirectional relationship between OrderHeader and OrderLine entities. However, there might be a slight issue with the usage of Lombok's @Builder annotation, which could potentially lead to the fields not being properly initialized.

Lombok's @Builder annotation should be used on constructors, not on instance methods. In your case, you should annotate the constructors of your entities with @Builder and ensure that the fields are being initialized correctly within the builder-generated constructor. Here's how you should modify your entities:

```java
@Entity
@Data
@Builder
public class OrderHeader extends BaseEntity {
private String name;
@OneToMany(mappedBy = "orderHeader", cascade = {CascadeType.PERSIST, CascadeType.REMOVE}, fetch = FetchType.EAGER)
private Set<OrderLine> orderLines;
}

@Entity
@Data
@Builder
public class OrderLine extends BaseEntity {

    @ManyToOne
    private OrderHeader orderHeader;

    private Long productId;
    private Integer quantityOrdered;

}
```
Notice that I've added the @Data annotation to your entities, which includes Lombok's @Builder functionality along with getters, setters, equals, hashCode, and toString methods. This will ensure that the builder pattern works correctly.

With this setup, your test method should work as expected:

```java
@Test
public void testOrderHeaderRepository() {
OrderLine orderLine1 = OrderLine.builder().quantityOrdered(1).productId(1L).build();
OrderLine orderLine2 = OrderLine.builder().quantityOrdered(1).productId(2L).build();

    OrderHeader orderHeader = OrderHeader.builder()
            .name("test order")
            .orderLines(new HashSet<OrderLine>() {{
                add(orderLine1);
                add(orderLine2);
            }})
            .build();

    orderLine1.setOrderHeader(orderHeader);
    orderLine2.setOrderHeader(orderHeader);

    OrderHeader orderHeaderSaved = orderHeaderRepository.save(orderHeader);
}
```

If you have your entities and relationships set up correctly and the @Builder annotation is applied to constructors as shown above, your test method should save the OrderHeader along with its associated OrderLine instances, and the foreign key relationships and values should be populated correctly in the database.

I added

```
@Entity

```

Note that lombok @Builder require @AllArgsConstructor

After that Only one orderLine (one from two) saved in database (with NULL values like before)
ChatGPT
I apologize for the confusion. Thank you for providing the additional information. The issue might be related to the way you are setting up and using Lombok's @Builder with JPA entities. To properly use @Builder with JPA entities, you need to make sure that the builder pattern is applied correctly and that your constructors are properly configured.

Here's how you can modify your entities to use Lombok's @Builder along with @NoArgsConstructor and @AllArgsConstructor to ensure proper initialization and saving of data:

```java
@Entity
@Data
@NoArgsConstructor
@AllArgsConstructor
@Builder
public class OrderHeader extends BaseEntity {
private String name;

    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "orderHeader", cascade = {CascadeType.PERSIST, CascadeType.REMOVE}, fetch = FetchType.EAGER)
    private Set<OrderLine> orderLines;
}

@Entity
@Data
@NoArgsConstructor
@AllArgsConstructor
@Builder
public class OrderLine extends BaseEntity {

    @ManyToOne
    private OrderHeader orderHeader;

    private Long productId;
    private Integer quantityOrdered;
}
```

In your test method, make sure you are using Lombok's @Builder to create instances:

```java

@Test
public void testOrderHeaderRepository() {
OrderLine orderLine1 = OrderLine.builder().quantityOrdered(1).productId(1L).build();
OrderLine orderLine2 = OrderLine.builder().quantityOrdered(1).productId(2L).build();

    OrderHeader orderHeader = OrderHeader.builder()
            .name("test order")
            .orderLines(new HashSet<OrderLine>() {{
                add(orderLine1);
                add(orderLine2);
            }})
            .build();

    orderLine1.setOrderHeader(orderHeader);
    orderLine2.setOrderHeader(orderHeader);

    OrderHeader orderHeaderSaved = orderHeaderRepository.save(orderHeader);
}
```
If you've made these changes and you're still experiencing issues with only one OrderLine being saved with NULL values, it might be helpful to check if there are any exceptions being thrown during the saving process. Also, ensure that the relationships are set correctly between the entities before saving. Double-check your database schema and ensure that the foreign key constraints are correctly set up. If the problem persists, it might be worth debugging step by step to identify the root cause of the issue.

Ok. Let's check How I create tables. Please ignore Customer, and date columns

```sql
    drop table if exists customer;
    drop table if exists order_header;
    drop table if exists order_line;

    create table customer (
       id bigint not null auto_increment,
        created_date timestamp,
        last_modified_date timestamp,
        version bigint,
        city varchar(128),
        state varchar(32),
        street_address varchar(255),
        zip_code varchar(10),
        email varchar(255),
        name varchar(255),
        phone varchar(32),
        primary key (id)
    ) engine=InnoDB;

    create table order_header (
       id bigint not null auto_increment,
        created_date timestamp,
        last_modified_date timestamp,
        version bigint,
        bill_to_city varchar(128),
        bill_to_state varchar(32),
        bill_to_address varchar(255),
        bill_to_zip_code varchar(10),
        name varchar(255),
        order_status varchar(32),
        shipping_city varchar(128),
        shipping_state varchar(32),
        shipping_address varchar(255),
        shipping_zip_code varchar(10),
        customer_id bigint,
        constraint order_customer_fk FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) references customer (id),
        primary key (id)
    ) engine=InnoDB;

    create table order_line (
       id bigint not null auto_increment,
        created_date timestamp,
        last_modified_date timestamp,
        version bigint,
        product_id bigint,
        quantity_ordered integer,
        order_header_id bigint,
        constraint order_header_pk FOREIGN KEY (order_header_id) references order_header(id),
#        constraint order_line_product_fk FOREIGN KEY (product_id) references product(id)
        primary key (id)
    ) engine=InnoDB;
```

this code for flyway to create tables. Do you see any issues?
ChatGPT
The SQL code you provided for creating the tables using Flyway looks generally fine. However, the issue you're facing might be related to the way the relationships are established between the entities in your Java code and how the data is being saved.

Here are a few things to double-check:

Foreign Key Constraints: Make sure that the foreign key constraints between order_line and order_header are correctly defined and match the relationship between OrderLine and OrderHeader in your Java code. The order_header_id column in the order_line table should reference the id column in the order_header table.

Setting Relationships: In your Java code, when you create OrderLine instances and associate them with an OrderHeader, make sure you're correctly setting the OrderHeader for each OrderLine. For example:

```java
OrderLine orderLine1 = OrderLine.builder()
.quantityOrdered(1)
.productId(1L)
.orderHeader(orderHeader) // Set the associated OrderHeader
.build();
```

Cascade Types: Since you're using cascade operations, verify that you're correctly persisting the OrderHeader instance, and the associated OrderLine instances will be persisted automatically due to the CascadeType.PERSIST configuration. You don't need to save the OrderLine instances separately.

Lombok @Builder: Make sure you're using Lombok's @Builder correctly as shown earlier in this conversation. The @Builder annotation should be on the class level and should generate the builder constructor, which should correctly initialize all the fields.

If you've carefully reviewed these aspects and still encounter issues, it might be helpful to debug your code step by step and inspect the values of the entities before saving them. This way, you can identify if any data is missing or not properly set in the relationships.

Explain your "The order_header_id column in the order_line table should reference the id column in the order_header table." What should I check in my entity mapping

```java
@Entity
public class OrderHeader extends BaseEntity {
    private String name;
    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "orderHeader", cascade = {CascadeType.PERSIST, CascadeType.REMOVE}, fetch = FetchType.EAGER)
    private Set<OrderLine> orderLines;
}

@Entity
public class OrderLine extends BaseEntity {

    @ManyToOne
    private OrderHeader orderHeader;

    private Long productId;
    private Integer quantityOrdered;

}
```

ChatGPT
In your database schema, you have a table named order_line with a column named order_header_id. This column represents a foreign key relationship between the order_line table and the order_header table. This relationship is established through the order_header_id column in the order_line table referencing the id column in the order_header table.

Here's how this is represented in your Java entity mapping:

```java
@Entity
public class OrderLine extends BaseEntity {

    @ManyToOne
    @JoinColumn(name = "order_header_id") // Specifies the column name for the foreign key
    private OrderHeader orderHeader;

    // Other properties
}
```
In the OrderLine entity class, the @ManyToOne annotation is used to define a many-to-one relationship with the OrderHeader entity. The @JoinColumn annotation is used to specify the column name (order_header_id) that represents the foreign key in the order_line table.

So, when you create an OrderLine instance and associate it with an OrderHeader instance, the order_header_id field in the order_line table should be populated with the corresponding id value of the associated OrderHeader instance.

Make sure that when you're creating and saving instances, you're correctly setting the relationship between OrderLine and OrderHeader, as shown in the previous responses. This ensures that the foreign key relationship is established in the database, allowing you to retrieve related data accurately.

```
ChatGPT
The Hibernate logs you provided indicate that the insert statement for the order_line table is being generated with binded null values for the order_header_id, product_id, and quantity_ordered columns. This behavior suggests that the values for these columns are not being properly set in your code before saving the entities.

The fact that these values are null might be causing the issue you're facing. Here are some things to check:

Relationship Setup: Make sure that when you create an OrderLine instance and associate it with an OrderHeader, you're correctly setting the OrderHeader for the OrderLine using the setOrderHeader() method.

Property Initialization: Ensure that you're setting the productId and quantityOrdered properties for each OrderLine instance before saving.

Debugging: Set breakpoints in your code where you create and set properties for OrderLine instances, and then step through to verify that these values are being set as expected.

Here's an example of how you might set up the OrderLine instances before saving:

```java

OrderLine orderLine1 = OrderLine.builder()
.orderHeader(orderHeader) // Set the associated OrderHeader
.productId(1L)
.quantityOrdered(5)
.build();

OrderLine orderLine2 = OrderLine.builder()
.orderHeader(orderHeader) // Set the associated OrderHeader
.productId(2L)
.quantityOrdered(3)
.build();

orderHeader.setOrderLines(new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList(orderLine1, orderLine2)));

OrderHeader orderHeaderSaved = orderHeaderRepository.save(orderHeader);
```

Remember that proper initialization of properties and setting relationships is crucial to ensure that the entities are saved with the correct data in the database. If you've verified these aspects and the issue still persists, there might be other factors involved that require deeper investigation.




User is it looks Ok

```java
        orderHeader.setOrderLines(new HashSet<OrderLine>() {{
            add(orderLine1);
            add(orderLine2);
        }});
```

ChatGPT
Yes, the code snippet you provided for setting up the OrderLine instances and adding them to the orderLines set of the OrderHeader looks correct. This code will properly associate the OrderLine instances with the OrderHeader and establish the necessary relationships between them.

Here's the snippet for reference:

```java
orderHeader.setOrderLines(new HashSet<OrderLine>() {{
add(orderLine1);
add(orderLine2);
}});
```

This code creates a new HashSet and uses the double-brace initialization pattern to add the OrderLine instances (orderLine1 and orderLine2) to the set. The orderLines set of the OrderHeader is then set to this newly created set, establishing the association between the OrderHeader and its OrderLine instances.

This approach should work as long as you have properly set up the bidirectional relationship between OrderHeader and OrderLine, and you've properly initialized the properties of OrderLine instances with their associated OrderHeader.

If you're still experiencing issues, it might be beneficial to review your code, especially around the points where you're setting up the relationships and properties of the entities, and step through it with a debugger to identify any potential issues.




User Ok I finally see that hibernate about to insert orderline entities with NOT NULL values but fail on recursive hashcode calculation

```
ChatGPT
The StackOverflowError you're encountering is caused by an issue in the way you've implemented the hashCode() method in your OrderHeader and OrderLine classes. The stack overflow occurs because your hashCode() implementation is causing an infinite loop due to the circular references between OrderHeader and OrderLine.

To resolve this issue, you need to make sure that your hashCode() methods do not create a circular loop by calling each other. You can avoid this by only considering the identifier (e.g., id field) for generating the hash code.

Here's how you can modify your OrderHeader and OrderLine classes to implement a proper hashCode() method:

```java
@Entity
public class OrderHeader extends BaseEntity {
// Other fields and methods

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        return Objects.hash(id); // Use the identifier for hash code
    }
}

@Entity
public class OrderLine extends BaseEntity {
// Other fields and methods

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        return Objects.hash(id); // Use the identifier for hash code
    }
}
```

In this example, I've overridden the hashCode() method in both OrderHeader and OrderLine classes to calculate the hash code based only on the id field. This avoids the circular reference issue while still providing a valid and consistent hash code implementation.

Remember that when overriding the equals() and hashCode() methods, it's important to consider only the fields that uniquely identify an entity. In most cases, this is the primary key or identifier field.




User
I rely on  lombok @Data to generate hashCode. All my entities have @Data annotation.
ChatGPT
Lombok's @Data annotation generates several methods, including hashCode(), based on the fields present in your class. The generated hashCode() method includes all the fields from your class, which can lead to issues if your entities have circular references. In cases like this, you might face a StackOverflowError due to the infinite loop in the hash code calculation.

To resolve this issue while still using Lombok's @Data annotation, you can selectively exclude fields from the hashCode() generation using the @EqualsAndHashCode annotation. This annotation allows you to specify which fields should be considered for equality and hash code calculation. By excluding the fields that create circular references, you can prevent the infinite loop and the resulting stack overflow.

Here's an example of how you can use the @EqualsAndHashCode annotation to exclude certain fields from hash code calculation:

```java
@Entity
@Data
public class OrderHeader extends BaseEntity {
private String name;

    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "orderHeader", cascade = {CascadeType.PERSIST, CascadeType.REMOVE}, fetch = FetchType.EAGER)
    @EqualsAndHashCode.Exclude // Exclude this field from hash code calculation
    private Set<OrderLine> orderLines;
}

@Entity
@Data
public class OrderLine extends BaseEntity {

    @ManyToOne
    @EqualsAndHashCode.Exclude // Exclude this field from hash code calculation
    private OrderHeader orderHeader;

    private Long productId;
    private Integer quantityOrdered;
}
```

By using @EqualsAndHashCode.Exclude, you can specify that the specified field should be excluded from hash code calculation. This should prevent the circular reference issue that was leading to the StackOverflowError.

Remember to analyze your use case and relationships carefully when excluding fields from hash code calculation. Fields that are necessary for equality comparison or hash code calculation should not be excluded.

WOW!!!  That was the last piece in puzzle we solved! Thank you!
