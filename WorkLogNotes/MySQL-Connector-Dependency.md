# Repository for MySQL Connector/J Dependency

Me - I'm trying to add mysql driver dependency in spring cloud maven pom file.
have an error - Could not find artifact mysql:mysql-connector-java:pom:unknown in netflix-candidates (https://artifactory-oss.prod.netflix.net/artifactory/maven-oss-candidates)

ChatGPT - The error message you're seeing indicates that the Maven dependency resolution process couldn't find the MySQL Connector/J artifact in the specified repository. It appears that you have configured your Maven build to use the Netflix Artifactory repository, but the MySQL Connector/J is not available in that repository.

To resolve this issue, you need to add the appropriate repository that hosts the MySQL Connector/J artifact. In this case, you can use the Maven Central Repository, which is a commonly used repository for hosting Java libraries.

To add the MySQL Connector/J dependency and the Maven Central Repository to your Spring Cloud Maven POM file, you can modify your <dependencies> and <repositories> sections as follows:

```xml
<dependencies>
  <!-- Other dependencies -->
  <dependency>
    <groupId>mysql</groupId>
    <artifactId>mysql-connector-java</artifactId>
    <version>8.0.23</version> <!-- Replace with your desired version -->
  </dependency>
</dependencies>

<repositories>
  <!-- Other repositories -->
  <repository>
    <id>central</id>
    <url>https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2</url>
    <releases>
      <enabled>true</enabled>
    </releases>
    <snapshots>
      <enabled>false</enabled>
    </snapshots>
  </repository>
</repositories>
```

By adding the <repository> block, Maven will now look for artifacts in the Maven Central Repository in addition to any other repositories you might have configured.

Make sure to replace 8.0.23 with the specific version of the MySQL Connector/J that you want to use. You can find the latest version on the Maven Central website or by searching for "MySQL Connector/J" on search.maven.org.

Save your modified POM file, and Maven should be able to resolve the MySQL Connector/J dependency from the Maven Central Repository during the build process.


Me - I haven't specify any repository for spring boot application. Why maven could find proper repository for spring boot dependencies.
ChatGPT - Spring Boot uses the Spring Boot Starter parent POM, which already includes the necessary repositories to resolve common dependencies. The Spring Boot Starter parent POM includes the Maven Central Repository and the Spring Repository by default.

If you are using the latest version of Spring Boot, it should already have the necessary repository configurations to resolve the MySQL Connector/J dependency. In that case, you don't need to explicitly add a repository configuration for Spring Boot dependencies.

The error message you encountered suggests that the repository you specified, https://artifactory-oss.prod.netflix.net/artifactory/maven-oss-candidates, does not contain the MySQL Connector/J artifact. It is possible that you have added this repository for additional dependencies specific to your project.

To resolve the issue, you can either remove the custom repository configuration and rely on the default repositories provided by Spring Boot, or you can specify a repository that includes the MySQL Connector/J artifact. One option is to add the Maven Central Repository as I mentioned in the previous response.

Please note that it's generally recommended to rely on the default repositories provided by Spring Boot and only add custom repositories when necessary for specific dependencies.


Me - In my other spring boot project I didn't have "artifactory-oss.prod.netflix.net" and maven could resolve repository for mysql driver without any effort from my side. Why after I add "/artifactory-oss.prod.netflix.net" required for spring cloud project  maven can't look for mysql driver in spring boot bom?
ChatGPT - It seems like the issue might be related to the repository configuration you added specifically for your Spring Cloud project. When you added the https://artifactory-oss.prod.netflix.net/artifactory/maven-oss-candidates repository, it might have overridden the default repositories provided by Spring Boot, causing Maven to only search in the Netflix Artifactory repository.

By doing so, Maven is unable to find the MySQL Connector/J dependency because it's not available in the Netflix Artifactory repository. The Spring Boot Bill of Materials (BOM) typically includes the necessary repositories, including the Maven Central Repository, to resolve common dependencies like the MySQL Connector/J.

To resolve the issue, you have a few options:

Remove the specific repository configuration you added (https://artifactory-oss.prod.netflix.net/artifactory/maven-oss-candidates) and rely on the default repositories provided by Spring Boot. This way, Maven will automatically search in the necessary repositories, including the Maven Central Repository, to resolve the MySQL Connector/J dependency.

If you need to keep the specific repository configuration for your Spring Cloud project, you can add an additional repository configuration for the Maven Central Repository in your POM file. This way, Maven will search in both repositories when resolving dependencies.

Here's an example of how you can add the Maven Central Repository along with your existing repository configuration:

```xml

<repositories>
  <!-- Existing repository configuration -->
  <repository>
    <id>netflix-candidates</id>
    <name>Netflix Artifactory Repository</name>
    <url>https://artifactory-oss.prod.netflix.net/artifactory/maven-oss-candidates</url>
  </repository>

  <!-- Maven Central Repository -->
  <repository>
    <id>central</id>
    <url>https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2</url>
    <releases>
      <enabled>true</enabled>
    </releases>
    <snapshots>
      <enabled>false</enabled>
    </snapshots>
  </repository>
</repositories>
```

By adding the repository configuration for the Maven Central Repository, Maven will search in both repositories when resolving dependencies, ensuring that it can find the MySQL Connector/J dependency.

Remember to adjust the repository configuration according to your needs and ensure that the necessary dependencies are specified correctly in your <dependencies> section.

It's important to note that adding custom repositories should be done cautiously, as it can affect the dependency resolution process and lead to conflicts or inconsistencies. It's generally recommended to rely on the default repositories provided by Spring Boot unless there's a specific need for custom repositories.
