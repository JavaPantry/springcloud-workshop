# How to send event to multiple listeners?
## Me - kafka how to send event to multiple listeners?

In Apache Kafka, events are typically published to topics, and multiple consumers can subscribe to those topics to receive the events. Kafka provides a publish-subscribe model, where events are sent to a topic, and any consumer that subscribes to that topic will receive a copy of the event. This allows you to send events to multiple listeners in a distributed and scalable manner.

Here's an overview of how you can send events to multiple listeners using Kafka:

Create a Kafka topic: First, you need to create a Kafka topic that will serve as the communication channel for your events. You can use the Kafka command-line tools or an API to create a topic.

Produce events to the topic: Once the topic is created, you can produce events to that topic. The events can be in any format, such as JSON, Avro, or plain text. Kafka provides a producer API that allows you to publish events to a specific topic.

Configure consumer groups: Kafka introduces the concept of consumer groups to enable parallel processing of events. A consumer group is a logical grouping of consumers that work together to process events from one or more topics. Each consumer within a group will receive a subset of the events based on the group's configuration.

Create consumers: To receive events, you need to create Kafka consumers. Consumers are responsible for subscribing to topics and consuming events from them. Consumers can be developed using various programming languages, as Kafka provides client libraries for several languages such as Java, Python, and more.

Subscribe consumers to the topic: When creating consumers, you specify the topic(s) to which they should subscribe. Kafka consumers can subscribe to multiple topics if required. By subscribing to the same topic, multiple consumers become part of the same consumer group and will collectively consume events from the topic.

Process events in consumer code: In your consumer code, you define the logic to process the events received from the subscribed topics. Each consumer within the group will receive a subset of the events, and Kafka takes care of load balancing the events across the consumers in the group.

By following these steps, you can send events to multiple listeners by publishing them to a Kafka topic and having multiple consumers subscribing to that topic. The consumers will receive copies of the events and can process them independently or as part of a consumer group.

## Me - I send event to kafka

`kafkaTemplate.send("orderTopic", new OrderPlacedEvent(productId, quantity));`

and have 2 application with listeners like one below

```
@KafkaListener(topics = "orderTopic")
	public void handleNotification(OrderPlacedEvent orderPlacedEvent) {
		log.info("StoreServiceApplication:: Received Order Notification for Product - {}", orderPlacedEvent.getProductId());
	}
```

only one listener receive event. What should I do to ensure both listeners will receive event?
ChatGPT
By default, when you have multiple listeners subscribed to the same topic in Kafka, the events will be load balanced across the listeners within the same consumer group. However, in your case, it seems like both of your listeners are not part of the same consumer group, which is why only one of them is receiving the events.

To ensure that both listeners receive the events, you need to make sure that they are part of the same consumer group. Here's what you can do:

Specify a consumer group ID: In your Kafka listeners, you need to specify a consumer group ID using the groupId property. This property determines which consumer group the listener belongs to. If you don't explicitly set a group ID, each listener will have a unique group ID, resulting in separate consumer groups.

```java
@KafkaListener(topics = "orderTopic", groupId = "myConsumerGroup")
public void handleNotification(OrderPlacedEvent orderPlacedEvent) {
log.info("StoreServiceApplication:: Received Order Notification for Product - {}", orderPlacedEvent.getProductId());
}
```
Configure the same group ID for both listeners: Make sure that both of your listeners have the same groupId specified. For example, you can set it to "myConsumerGroup" as shown above.
By specifying the same groupId, both listeners will join the same consumer group, and Kafka will automatically load balance the events across the listeners. Each listener within the group will receive a subset of the events, allowing both listeners to process the events simultaneously.

Remember that if you want each listener to receive a copy of every event, you need to ensure that they belong to different consumer groups with unique groupId values. In that case, each listener will receive all the events independently.





## Me - In both applications with listeners I have groupId defined in property file

- `spring.kafka.consumer.group-id=orderTopicId`


If you have specified the group.id property in the property file for both applications, but they still don't receive events concurrently, there might be a couple of reasons for this behavior:

Consumer group ID conflict: Ensure that the group.id property is unique for each application. If both applications have the same group.id value, Kafka will consider them as part of the same consumer group, and load balancing will occur. However, if the group.id property is the same, it's possible that only one consumer from the same group is active, resulting in only one listener receiving the events. Verify that the group.id property is distinct for each application.

Different group.id properties: Check if the group.id property is being read correctly by both applications. Ensure that the property is correctly specified in the respective property files for each application. Additionally, confirm that the property is being used by the Kafka listener configuration.

Here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

Verify the consumer group IDs: Double-check the group.id values specified in the property files of both applications. Confirm that they are different and unique.

Check Kafka logs: Inspect the logs of both applications and the Kafka broker for any relevant error messages or warnings that could shed light on the issue. Look for any indications of consumer group conflicts or rebalancing problems.

Check consumer registration: Ensure that both listeners are successfully registering with the Kafka broker as consumers and subscribing to the desired topic. Look for any errors or warnings related to consumer registration.

Monitor consumer group activity: Use Kafka administration tools or command-line utilities to monitor the consumer groups and their activity. Check if both consumer groups are active and have members assigned.

Restart applications: Try restarting both applications to ensure that they properly establish new consumer group instances and perform the necessary rebalancing.

If the issue persists, it may be helpful to provide more details about the environment, such as the Kafka version, the specific configuration being used, and any relevant error messages or logs, to assist in further troubleshooting.

## Me - Yes. This is a reason. Once I change group-id in each application  to be unique they start receive events.

## Me - Can I summarize what would be remedy for issue, -  Only one event listener in group will receive event from one topic.   All event listeners of one topic in different groups will receive event.

To summarize the solution for the issue where only one event listener in a consumer group receives events from a topic:

Ensure that each event listener belongs to a unique consumer group by setting a distinct group.id for each listener/application.
Verify that the group.id property is correctly specified in the configuration of each listener/application, either in the code or in the property file.
Confirm that the consumer group IDs are being read correctly by the listeners/applications.
Restart the listeners/applications to establish new consumer group instances and trigger rebalancing if necessary.
Monitor the logs and check the consumer group activity to ensure all listeners are successfully registering as consumers and actively consuming events.
In summary, by setting unique consumer group IDs for each event listener, Kafka will load balance the events across the listeners within the same group, allowing multiple listeners to receive events concurrently. If listeners belong to different consumer groups, each group will independently receive all the events from the topic.





## Me - Can I define groupId in @KafkaListener annotation and skip define groupId in application property?

Yes, it is possible to define the groupId directly in the @KafkaListener annotation without explicitly specifying it in the application property.

Here's an example of how you can define the groupId in the @KafkaListener annotation:

```java
@KafkaListener(topics = "orderTopic", groupId = "myConsumerGroup")
public void handleNotification(OrderPlacedEvent orderPlacedEvent) {
    // Event handling logic
}
```

In this case, the groupId is specified within the @KafkaListener annotation itself. This approach allows you to configure the consumer group ID at the listener level, providing more flexibility if you have different listeners requiring different consumer group IDs.

By defining the groupId directly in the @KafkaListener annotation, it takes precedence over any other configuration sources, such as the application properties. Therefore, the groupId specified in the annotation will be used for that specific listener.

However, it's important to note that if you have multiple listeners within the same application and you want them to share the same consumer group ID, you will need to define the groupId consistently for all of them, either through the annotation or the application properties.

## Me - how I can map more than one mapping for kafka producer in application properties file?

To map more than one Kafka producer in the application properties file, you can use the following syntax:

```properties
spring.kafka.producer.[producerName].property=value
```

Here, [producerName] is the placeholder for the name of your Kafka producer. You can choose any meaningful name to identify each producer configuration. By using this syntax, you can define multiple sets of properties for different Kafka producers.

Here's an example of how you can configure two Kafka producers, "producer1" and "producer2", in the application.properties file:

```properties
# Kafka Producer 1
spring.kafka.producer.producer1.bootstrap-servers=localhost:9092
spring.kafka.producer.producer1.key-serializer=org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer
spring.kafka.producer.producer1.value-serializer=org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer

# Kafka Producer 2
spring.kafka.producer.producer2.bootstrap-servers=localhost:9092
spring.kafka.producer.producer2.key-serializer=org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer
spring.kafka.producer.producer2.value-serializer=org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer
```

In the above example, we have defined two Kafka producers, "producer1" and "producer2". Each producer has its own set of properties prefixed with spring.kafka.producer.[producerName]. You can customize the properties for each producer based on your requirements.

In your application code, you can reference the respective producer name when using the KafkaTemplate. For example:

```java

@Autowired
@Qualifier("producer1")
private KafkaTemplate<String, String> kafkaTemplate1;

@Autowired
@Qualifier("producer2")
private KafkaTemplate<String, String> kafkaTemplate2;
```

By using the @Qualifier annotation with the respective producer name, you can inject the desired KafkaTemplate instance for each producer configuration.

This approach allows you to define and configure multiple Kafka producers with different sets of properties, enabling you to send messages to different Kafka topics or configure them differently based on your application's requirements.


## Me - I meant not  "more than one producer", but "more than one event class mapping for one producer"

I apologize for the misunderstanding. To map more than one event class for a single Kafka producer, you can define multiple Kafka topics and their corresponding event mappings in the application properties file.

Here's an example of how you can map multiple event classes to a single Kafka producer in the application.properties file:

```properties

spring.kafka.producer.bootstrap-servers=localhost:9092
spring.kafka.producer.key-serializer=org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer
spring.kafka.producer.value-serializer=org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer

# Topic 1 Configuration
spring.kafka.template.default-topic=topic1
spring.kafka.producer.properties.topic1.value.serializer=org.example.MyEventSerializer1

# Topic 2 Configuration
spring.kafka.producer.properties.topic2.value.serializer=org.example.MyEventSerializer2
```

In this example, we have a single Kafka producer configured with general properties. Then, we define different topics (e.g., topic1 and topic2) and their respective value serializers (org.example.MyEventSerializer1 and org.example.MyEventSerializer2).

To send an event of a specific class using this producer, you can simply set the topic name when using the KafkaTemplate's send() method. For example:

```java
@Autowired
private KafkaTemplate<String, MyEvent> kafkaTemplate;

public void sendEvent1(MyEvent event) {
kafkaTemplate.send("topic1", event);
}

public void sendEvent2(MyEvent event) {
kafkaTemplate.send("topic2", event);
}
```

In the code above, we have a KafkaTemplate injected, and we send events to the corresponding topics by specifying the topic name in the send() method.

By configuring different topics and serializers for each event class, you can map multiple event classes to a single Kafka producer and send events to the appropriate topic based on the event type.

Remember to adjust the serializer classes (org.example.MyEventSerializer1 and org.example.MyEventSerializer2) to match the serialization logic for your specific event classes.




## Me - No. I meant "spring.kafka.producer.properties.spring.json.type.mapping=event:com.springcloud.sbsuite.event.OrderPlacedEvent" . How I can add 2nd class to mapping?

I apologize for the confusion. Unfortunately, the spring.kafka.producer.properties.spring.json.type.mapping property in Spring Kafka does not support mapping multiple event classes to a single producer using the built-in configuration.

The spring.kafka.producer.properties.spring.json.type.mapping property allows you to configure the mapping of a single event class to its corresponding type in the JSON message. However, it doesn't provide a way to map multiple event classes within the same property.

If you have multiple event classes and you need to map them to a single producer with different serialization configurations, you may need to consider alternative approaches. Here are a couple of suggestions:

Use a custom serializer: Implement a custom serializer that can handle multiple event classes and their serialization logic. You can define a common interface or superclass for your event classes and implement the serialization logic accordingly. Then, configure your Kafka producer to use the custom serializer.

Separate producers: If the event classes have distinct serialization requirements or are intended for different Kafka topics, you can define separate Kafka producers for each event class. Each producer can have its own configuration and serialization logic, allowing you to send events with the desired settings.

Here's an example of how you can define separate producers for different event classes:

```java
@Configuration
public class KafkaProducerConfig {

    @Bean
    public ProducerFactory<String, OrderPlacedEvent> orderPlacedEventProducerFactory() {
        Map<String, Object> configProps = new HashMap<>();
        // Configure the producer properties specific to OrderPlacedEvent
        // ...

        return new DefaultKafkaProducerFactory<>(configProps);
    }

    @Bean
    public KafkaTemplate<String, OrderPlacedEvent> orderPlacedEventKafkaTemplate() {
        return new KafkaTemplate<>(orderPlacedEventProducerFactory());
    }

    @Bean
    public ProducerFactory<String, AnotherEvent> anotherEventProducerFactory() {
        Map<String, Object> configProps = new HashMap<>();
        // Configure the producer properties specific to AnotherEvent
        // ...

        return new DefaultKafkaProducerFactory<>(configProps);
    }

    @Bean
    public KafkaTemplate<String, AnotherEvent> anotherEventKafkaTemplate() {
        return new KafkaTemplate<>(anotherEventProducerFactory());
    }
}
```

In this configuration, we define separate ProducerFactory and KafkaTemplate beans for each event class (OrderPlacedEvent and AnotherEvent). Each bean has its own configuration properties specific to the corresponding event class.

With this approach, you can autowire the respective KafkaTemplate instances in your code and use them to send events of the corresponding types.

These suggestions provide flexibility to handle multiple event classes with different serialization requirements or destination topics within the same application. Choose the approach that best fits your use case.
