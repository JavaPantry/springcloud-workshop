# GPTChat - introduce local/docker profiles

## Me - I have maven project with multiple sub modules with their own pom files. Where I have to define active profile, in root pom file or in each submodule's poms?
ChatGPT
You can define active profiles in both the root pom.xml file and the individual submodule pom.xml files, but it's generally better to define them in the root pom.xml file.

When you define an active profile in the root pom.xml file, it applies to all the submodules unless they override the profile by defining their own. This approach provides a centralized way to manage the project's profiles, and it ensures that the same profile configuration is used consistently across all the modules.

However, if you need a specific profile configuration for a particular submodule, you can define the active profile in the submodule's pom.xml file. This approach overrides the configuration defined in the root pom.xml file for that submodule only.

In summary, it's generally best to define active profiles in the root pom.xml file, but you can override them in individual submodule pom.xml files if necessary.





## Me - I want use one hostname when all services runs in docker container and localhost when runs from IDE.  What's best profile names?
ChatGPT
You can define two different profiles in your Maven project to achieve this. One profile can be used for the Docker container environment, and another profile for the local environment when running from an IDE.

Here are some suggested profile names:

docker: This profile can be activated when running in a Docker container. You can configure the profile to use a specific hostname for your services.

local: This profile can be activated when running from an IDE on your local machine. You can configure the profile to use the localhost hostname for your services.

To activate a specific profile, you can use the -P option with Maven. For example, to activate the docker profile, you can run the following command:


`mvn clean install -Pdocker`
And to activate the local profile, you can run the following command:


`mvn clean install -Plocal`
You can also configure default profile activation in your settings.xml file by adding the following code:

```php

<settings>
<activeProfiles>
<activeProfile>local</activeProfile>
</activeProfiles>
</settings>
```

This code activates the local profile by default if no profile is specified.





## Me - I think  to activate local profile when debugging applications and docker by default. In this case I should not worry about build docker files.
ChatGPT
Yes, that's a valid approach. If you want to activate the local profile by default when debugging applications and the docker profile when building Docker images, you can configure your settings.xml file as follows:

```xml
<settings>
<profiles>
<profile>
<id>debug</id>
<activation>
<property>
<name>debug</name>
<value>true</value>
</property>
</activation>
<properties>
<env>local</env>
</properties>
</profile>
</profiles>
<activeProfiles>
<activeProfile>docker</activeProfile>
</activeProfiles>
</settings>
```
In this example, the debug profile is activated when the debug property is set to true. The env property is set to local for the debug profile, which activates the local profile by default.

When the debug property is not set, the docker profile is activated by default because it's included in the activeProfiles section.

Note that this assumes you're using a Maven plugin like maven-exec-plugin to run your application for debugging purposes. You can pass the debug property to the plugin to activate the local profile. For example:

`mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=com.example.MyApplication -Ddebug=true`

This command activates the debug profile and sets the debug property to true, which activates the local profile by default.


## Me - It's a good idea, but I was thinking to have "local" profile defined in root pom file and activate it in IntelliJ Maven panel when run apps locally.
Default "hostnameurl" property defined in application.property file and overriden in application-local.property file. Thus when I check "local" profile  in IntelliJ maven panel IntelliJ will run all services locally. But if I run docker-compose maven will build applications with  "hostnameurl" property defined in application.property.
ChatGPT
Yes, that's another good approach. In this case, you can define the local profile in the root pom.xml file and activate it in the IntelliJ Maven panel when you run the application locally. You can also use a separate application-local.properties file to override the default hostnameurl property for the local profile.

Here's an example of how you can define the local profile in the root pom.xml file:

```xml

<profiles>
<profile>
<id>local</id>
<activation>
<activeByDefault>false</activeByDefault>
</activation>
<properties>
<hostnameurl>localhost</hostnameurl>
</properties>
</profile>
</profiles>
```

In this example, the local profile is not activated by default, but you can activate it in the IntelliJ Maven panel by checking the box next to the profile name.

To override the hostnameurl property for the local profile, you can create a separate application-local.properties file with the following content:

`hostnameurl=localhost`

When the local profile is activated, the Maven plugin reads the application-local.properties file and overrides the hostnameurl property with the value specified in the file.

When you run the docker-compose command to build and run the application in a Docker container, the local profile is not activated, so the default hostnameurl property value in the application.properties file is used.

Note that if you have multiple submodules with their own application.properties files, you need to make sure that the application-local.properties file is in the same directory as the application.properties file for each submodule.





## Me - If I want use  profile name "local-dev" instead of "local" how should I name application.properties file?
ChatGPT
If you want to use the profile name "local-dev" instead of "local", you can create a local-dev profile in your pom.xml file with the application.properties file named as application-local-dev.properties.

Here's an example of how to define the local-dev profile:

```xml
<profiles>
<profile>
<id>local-dev</id>
<activation>
<activeByDefault>false</activeByDefault>
</activation>
<properties>
<hostnameurl>localhost</hostnameurl>
</properties>
</profile>
</profiles>
```
And here's an example of how to name the application.properties file for the local-dev profile:

`application-local-dev.properties`

When you activate the local-dev profile, Maven will look for the application-local-dev.properties file and load the properties defined in the file.

Note that if you have multiple submodules with their own application.properties files, you need to make sure that the application-local-dev.properties file is in the same directory as the application.properties file for each submodule.





## Me - here is my root pom.xml file

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

    <profiles>
        <profile>
            <id>local-dev</id>
            <activation>
                <activeByDefault>false</activeByDefault>
            </activation>
            <properties>
                <hostnameurl>localhost</hostnameurl>
            </properties>
        </profile>
    </profiles>
</project>
```

as you notice I defined `<hostnameurl>host.docker.internal</hostnameurl>` in properties
and as you suggest `<hostnameurl>localhost</hostnameurl>` overriden within local-dev profile?
Can I do this without creating application-local-dev.properties in each submodule?
ChatGPT
Yes, you can define the hostnameurl property in the root pom.xml and override it in the local-dev profile without creating application-local-dev.properties files in each submodule.

When you define a property in the root pom.xml, it is inherited by all the submodules. So, you only need to define the property once in the root pom.xml and it will be available to all the submodules.

Here's an updated example of your root pom.xml file with the hostnameurl property defined in the root pom.xml and overridden in the local-dev profile:

```xml
<project>
<groupId>com.springcloud.sbsuite</groupId>
<artifactId>springcloud-sbsuite-pom</artifactId>
<version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
<packaging>pom</packaging>

  <properties>
    <java.version>17</java.version>
    <hostnameurl>host.docker.internal</hostnameurl>
  </properties>

  <profiles>
    <profile>
      <id>local-dev</id>
      <activation>
        <activeByDefault>false</activeByDefault>
      </activation>
      <properties>
        <hostnameurl>localhost</hostnameurl>
      </properties>
    </profile>
  </profiles>

  <modules>
    <module>config-server</module>
    <module>eureka-server</module>
    <module>inventory-service</module>
    <module>store-service</module>
    <module>api-gateway</module>
  </modules>
</project>
```

With this configuration, the hostnameurl property will default to host.docker.internal unless the local-dev profile is activated. When the local-dev profile is activated, the hostnameurl property will be overridden to localhost for all submodules.

## Me - does it matter if you put "profiles" section in front of "modules"?
ChatGPT
No, it doesn't matter if you put the profiles section before or after the modules section in the pom.xml file. The ordering of the elements in the pom.xml file does not affect the functionality of Maven.

However, it is a convention to put the modules section after the profiles section. This is because the profiles section is typically used to configure the build environment, while the modules section is used to define the project's submodules. Placing the profiles section before the modules section can help to make the build configuration easier to understand and maintain.





## Me - Oh... I miss the point that this "hostnameurl" should be used in submodules application.properties file.. How I can replace hardcoded "localhost" in "eureka.client.service-url.defaultZone=http://localhost:8761/eureka" with value of "hostnameurl"?
ChatGPT
You can use the ${hostnameurl} placeholder in your application.properties file to dynamically reference the value of the hostnameurl property that is defined in your parent pom.xml file.

To replace the hardcoded localhost in your eureka.client.service-url.defaultZone property with the value of hostnameurl, you can modify the property in your application.properties file like this:


`eureka.client.service-url.defaultZone=http://${hostnameurl}:8761/eureka`

This will replace the localhost in the URL with the value of the hostnameurl property, which is either localhost or host.docker.internal, depending on which profile is active.

Note that this assumes that you have added the spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-client dependency to your project. If you have not yet done so, you will need to add it to the pom.xml file of each submodule that uses Eureka.





## Me - with activated "local-dev" profile I have an error when spring cloud config server started

- Request execution failed with message: I/O error on POST request for "http://$%257Bhostnameurl%257D:8761/eureka/apps/CONFIG-SERVER": $%257Bhostnameurl%257D

looks like spring have NOT replaced "hostnameurl" in `eureka.client.service-url.defaultZone=http://${hostnameurl}:8761/eureka`. Any idea what is the problem?
ChatGPT
It looks like the ${hostnameurl} placeholder in your application.properties file is not being resolved correctly.

One possible reason for this is that you have defined the hostnameurl property in the <properties> section of your parent pom.xml file, but you have not passed it down to your submodule's application.properties file.

To pass the hostnameurl property down to your submodule's application.properties file, you can define it in your parent pom.xml file using the <properties> section, like you have already done, and then add the following to your submodule's pom.xml file:

```xml
<build>
<resources>
<resource>
<directory>src/main/resources</directory>
<filtering>true</filtering>
</resource>
</resources>
</build>
```

This will enable resource filtering for your submodule, which means that Maven will replace any occurrences of ${hostnameurl} in your application.properties file with the actual value of the hostnameurl property that is defined in your parent pom.xml file.

Another possible reason for the error you are seeing is that you have not activated the local-dev profile correctly. Make sure that you have set the spring.profiles.active property to local-dev when running your application. You can do this by adding the following to your application's startup command:


`-Dspring.profiles.active=local-dev`

Alternatively, you can set the spring.profiles.active property in your application.properties file, like this:


`spring.profiles.active=local-dev`

Make sure that you have also removed the activeByDefault element from your local-dev profile in your parent pom.xml file, so that it is not activated by default.

## Me - Is it possible that issue arose because I start all modules one by one instead of running them from root pom file? In this way of starting they are not aware of active profile and "hostnameurl" property.
ChatGPT
Yes, that's possible. When you run the modules separately instead of running them from the root POM, they won't have access to the properties defined in the root POM or the active profiles. To ensure that the properties and profiles are picked up correctly, you should run the modules from the root POM using the mvn command with the appropriate profile(s) activated. For example, if you want to activate the local-dev profile, you can run the following command from the root directory of your project:

`mvn clean install -Plocal-dev`

This will ensure that the modules are built with the correct profile and properties.

## Me - Looks like I find a solution to one-by-one run microservices with local-dev profile in IntelliJ. Not perfect but the one I can understand and manage. I had to create application-local-dev.properties in each submodule.

Then edit Run/Debug configuration for each microservice submodule by adding active profile  local-dev.
ChatGPT
Great to hear that you found a solution! It's true that running each microservice individually can cause some issues with profile activation and property resolution, but adding the active profile to the Run/Debug configuration should work. Additionally, creating an application-local-dev.properties file in each submodule with the correct properties is also necessary for the configuration to work properly.
